### Run the MCP Server Locally with MCP Inspector

If you'd like to run MCP Inspector locally to test the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/-mcp-starwars
   ```

1. Install the required dependencies and build the project.

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

1. (Optional) To try out the server using MCP Inspector run the following command:

   ```bash
   # Start the MCP Inspector
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
   ```

   Visit the MCP Inspector URL shown in the console in your browser. Change `Arguments` to `dist/index.js` and select `Connect`. Select `List Tools` to see the available tools.

## Running the MCP Server hosted in GitHub Copilot with VS Code Insiders

> **Note**: If you already have the MCP server enabled with Claude Desktop, add `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled: true` in your VS Code settings and it will discover existing MCP server lists.

If you want to associate the MCP server with a specific repo, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with this content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [],
  "servers": {
    "mcp-starwars": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/mcp-starwars"
        // "_git/mcp-starwars/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to associate the MCP server with all repos, add the following to your VS Code User Settings JSON:

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "mcp-starwars": {
      "command": "npx",
      // "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@johnpapa/mcp-starwars"
        // "/Users/papa/_git/mcp-starwars/dist/index.js"
        // "_git/mcp-starwars/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
"chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
```

### Using Tools in GitHub Copilot

1. Now that the mcp server is discoverable, open GitHub Copilot and select the `Agent` mode (not `Chat` or `Edits`).
2. Select the "refresh" button in the Copilot chat text field to refresh the server list.
3. Select the "üõ†Ô∏è" button to see all the possible tools, including the ones from this repo.
4. Put a question in the chat that would naturally invoke one of the tools, for example:

   ```
   How do I set my VS Code accent colors?
   ```
